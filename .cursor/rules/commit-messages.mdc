# Commits: NO AI assistant attribution — policy

**We do not want any commit that mentions any AI assistant.** This applies to this repo and any repo you touch.

When creating or suggesting git commits in this project:

1. **Never include** `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or any Co-authored-by/trailer that mentions Cursor, cursoragent, an AI, or an agent. Remove it before committing if the IDE adds it.
2. **Never include** any Cursor mention or AI/agent attribution in the subject or body. No "Cursor", "AI agent", "cursoragent", "assistant", or similar.
3. Use **neutral, descriptive** commit messages only.

**Enforcement:** Use the prepare-commit-msg hook. Copy from `~/.cursor/git-hooks/prepare-commit-msg` into this repo: `cp ~/.cursor/git-hooks/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/ && chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`. Or set `git config core.hooksPath ~/.cursor/git-hooks` from this repo root.
